\question[2]
We will show that the universal recursive function $U : \NN^2 \rightharpoonup \NN$ is not total,
and that there is no total recursive function $U'$ containing it.
\begin{proof}
	We defined the universal function over the domain of coded $\Sigma_1$-formulas, and directly by past constructions the number $1$ does not codify such a formula.
	Let us assume towards a contradiction that there is $U' \supseteq U$ total recursive function.

	$U' : \NN^2 \to \NN$ is recursive, then using projections we get that $g : \NN \to \NN$ which defined by $g(x) = U'(\operatorname{Le}(x), \operatorname{Re}(x))$ is recursive as well.
	There is a code for $g$ such that $U(e, cd(x, y)) = g(cd(x, y)) = U'(x, y)$ for all values.
	In particular for $x = e$, $U(e, cd(e, y)) = U'(e, y)$


\end{proof}

\question{}
For every $l \in \NN$ we define $b_l : \NN \to \NN$ by $b_0(n) = 2n$, $b_{l + 1}(n) = b_l^{n + 1}(1)$ in the sense of composition.
Let $B(l, n) = b_l(n)$, such that $B(0, n) = 2n, B(l + 1, 0) = B(l, 1)$ and $B(l + 1, n + 1) = B(l, B(l + 1, n))$.

\subquestion{}
We will show that for any $l \in \NN$, $b_l$ is primitive-recursive.
