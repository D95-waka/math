\question{}
Let $L = \{ P \}$ a language where $P$ is unary relation.
Define,
\[
	\varphi_n
	= \exists x_0 \ldots \exists x_n \left( \bigwedge_{i \le n} P(x_i) \land \bigwedge_{i < j \le n} x_i \ne x_j \right),
	\quad
	\psi_n
	= \exists x_0 \ldots \exists x_n \left( \bigwedge_{i \le n} \lnot P(x_i) \land \bigwedge_{i < j \le n} x_i \ne x_j \right)
\]
and let $T = \{ \varphi_n, \psi_n \mid n < \omega \}$. \\
We will show that $\cl_{\vdash} T$ is $\omega$-categorical.
\begin{proof}
	Let $\Mm \models T$ be some model.
	It can be proved by direct induction that $|P^\Mm| = \omega$ as well as $|\lnot P^\Mm| = \omega$.
	Let us construct $f : \omega \to M$ such that $f(n) \in P^\Mm$ for any $n < \omega$.
	$\Mm \models \varphi_0 \iff \Mm \models \exists x\ P(x)$ then let $f(0)$ be such witness.
	Let us assume that $f \restriction n$ is defined, then $\Mm \models \varphi_{n + 1}$, then by the pigeonhole principle there is some $a \in \Mm$ such that $a \notin f '' n$, and let $f(n + 1) = a$.
	For the sake of convenience let us redefine $f$ as $2 \times \omega \to M$ injective function such that $f(0, n)$ is the same as $f(n)$ and $f(1, n) \notin P^\Mm$.
	By CSB we can assume that $f$ is bijection as well, and by the selection of $\Mm$ as an arbitrary model of $T$ we can deduce that for any $\Mm, \Nn \models T$, $\Mm \cong \Nn$ by composition of functions as was constructed.
\end{proof}

\question{}
Let $L = \{ c_n \mid n < \omega \}$ be language consists of constant symbols.
Let us define the theory $T = \{ c_i \ne c_j \mid i < j < \omega \}$. \\
We will show that there are countably many non-isomorphic countable models of $T$, and that $T$ is complete.
\begin{proof}
	Let us define the model $\Mm_n$ such that $M = \omega$ and,
	\[
		c_i^\Mm = i + n
	\]
	for any $i < j < \omega$,
	\[
		c_i^\Mm
		= i + n
		\ne j + n
		= c_j^\Mm
	\]
	therefore $\Mm_n \models T$.
	$\Mm_n \models k \ne c_i$ for all $i < \omega$, in particular $\Mm_n \models \exists x\ x \ne c_i$.
	It is implied that also,
	\[
		\Mm_n
		\models \exists x_0 \ldots \exists x_{k - 1} \left( \bigwedge_{i < j < k} x_i \ne x_j \land x_i \ne c_l \right)
		= \varphi_l^k
	\]
	for all $l < \omega$.
	Finally, $\Mm_n \not\models \varphi_l^k$ for any $k > n$, we deduce that $\Mm_n \not\cong \Mm_m$ for any $n \ne m$.

	We move to show that $T$ is complete.
	Let us assume toward a contradiction that $\varphi$ is a sentence such that $\varphi \notin T$ and $T \cup \{ \varphi \}$ is consistent.
	By construction of Henkin models we can deduce that $\Mm_0 \models \varphi$, but $\Mm_0$ is minimal, namely if $\Nn \models T$ then $\Mm_0 \subseteq \Nn$,
	then by definition $T \models \varphi$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\question{}
We will show that $\Th(\NN, +, \cdot)$ has $2^{\aleph_0}$ non-isomorphic countable models.
\begin{proof}
	Let $f : \omega \to P$ be the map between number and its respective prime in the order induced from $\NN$, namely $f(0) = 2, f(1) = 3, \ldots$.
	assuming that $A \subseteq \omega$ is some set, we define $\Mm_A = (\cl_{+, \cdot}(f(A)), +, \cdot)$.
	\[
		\Mm_A \models \exists p \forall x\ p \cdot x = \underline{p} \cdot x
	\]
	when $\underline{p}$ acts as numeral, and $\underline{p} \cdot x$ is abbreviation to $x + \cdots + x$ $p$ times.
	Let us denote this sentence as $\varphi_p$, then,
	\[
		\Mm_A \models \{ \varphi_{f(a)} \mid a \in A \}
	\]
	as well,
	\[
		\Mm_A \not\models \{ \varphi_q \mid q \notin \cl_+ A \}
	\]
	Therefore if $A, B \subseteq \omega$ and $A \ne B$ then $\Mm_A \not\cong \Mm_B$, thus there are $|\Pp(\omega)|$ non-isomorphic countable models.
\end{proof}

\question{}
Let $\kappa \ge \omega$ be some cardinal and let $L$ be some language.
Let $T$ be a $\kappa$-categorical $L$-theory such that it has no finite models.
We will show that $T$ can be incomplete.
\begin{solution}
	Let $L = \{ c_{\alpha} \mid \alpha < \delta \} \cup \{ P \}$ for $\kappa < \delta$, where $c_{\alpha}$ is a constant symbol and $P$ is unary relation.
	\[
		T = \{ c_{\alpha} \ne c_{\beta} \mid \alpha < \beta < \delta \} \cup \{ P(c_{\alpha}) \mid \alpha < \delta \}
	\]
	It follows from the definition of $T$ that if $\Mm \models T$ then $|M| \ge \delta > \kappa$, therefore there are no models of $T$ of cardinality $\kappa$, then the theory is vacuously complete.

	Just take $\kappa = \omega$ and $L$ and $T$ from question 1, we saw that $T$ is $\omega$-categorical and has no finite models.
	We also know that if $\Mm \models T$ and $|M| > \kappa$ then $|P^\Mm|, |\lnot P^\Mm| \ge \omega$, and therefore it is possible that $|P^\Mm| = |M|$ or $|P^\Mm| < |M|$, then $T$ cannot be complete.
\end{solution}

\question{}
Let $T = \Th(\QQ, \le)$ be DLO\@. \\
We will show that $T$ is not $\kappa$-categorical for some uncountable cardinal $\kappa$.
\begin{proof}
	The key here is similar to question 4, we can define $P(x) \iff x \le c$ for some arbitrary value.
	This is equivalent to the theory of 4 and 1, and we just talked about why this is not necessarily $\kappa$-categorical.
\end{proof}
